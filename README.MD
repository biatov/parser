## How it works ##

- **def** check_pages (Check how many pages are in this catalog)
- **def** record (Write data to csv file)
- **def** find_data (Look for tags in html)
- **def** get_value_info (Gets the text of the tag. Deletes the commas, we do not need the extra commas in csv)
- **def** collect_info (Gather all the information about the product. Check whether there is a photo)
- **def** process (Start of the functions described above. Listing pages. Collection of information. An entry in the file.)
